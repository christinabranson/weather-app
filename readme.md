# Weather/Rain Tracker *or* Should I Water My Garden?

## Overview

This is a pretty straightforward app written in Django/Python will a simple goal: telling me whether or not I should water my garden that day.

We use the DarkSky API to retrieve the forecasted rain amounts. We also have the ability to enter manual data (ie: if I watered with a hose) in the Django admin.

We're also using the [Creative Tim Light Bootstrap Dashboard](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/light-bootstrap-dashboard) for prettiness. Charts are with [Chartist](https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/)
